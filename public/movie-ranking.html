<h1>Favorite movies of Ruchita</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Anand</h3>
<p>This is a 2000s movie and is very nostalgic. It is one of my comfort movies.</p>
<h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
<p>This was my first anime movie and it has gorgeous animations by Hayao Miyazaki. The story is pretty decent as well.</p>
<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>This is a teen vampire movie and I would not recommend it to someone. It's just something that I like.</p>
